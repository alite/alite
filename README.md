Nice to see you on my github page â€¦

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on  a *world building* or *investigation* app, called
  [QuaMundo](https://github.com/QuaMundo/quamundo), based on the [Ruby on
  Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) framework.

- ðŸŒ± Therefore Iâ€™m currently learning [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby),
  Rails and handling some JavaScript libraries as well as
  [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) and
  [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) testing frameworks

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love :evergreen_tree: hanging around in nature and
  :musical_note: playing my trombone
